# Analytics Engineering Project: Northwind Traders Data Analysis

![Project Logo](C:\Users\joshua.omondi\Downloads\dbt.png) <!-- Add your project logo here -->

## Overview

This project showcases an analytics engineering process using Google BigQuery and dbt to analyze the Northwind Traders dataset. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to set up a dbt project, create various layers of data transformation, and generate meaningful insights from the data.

## Project Structure

- `/dbt_project`: The root directory of the dbt project.
  - `/models`: Contains dbt models for different data transformation layers.
    - `staging`: Data loading and initial staging models.
    - `warehouse`: Transformation models creating the warehouse layer.
    - `analytics`: Aggregations and calculations for generating insights.
  - `dbt_project.yml`: dbt project configuration file.
- `/sql`: SQL scripts for data extraction and other data manipulation tasks.
- `/data`: Raw data files and documentation related to the Northwind Traders dataset.
- `README.md`: You are here.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your Google BigQuery project and credentials.
3. Initialize a dbt project in the `/dbt_project` directory.
4. Configure your `dbt_project.yml` and profiles settings to connect to your BigQuery project.
5. Run dbt models to transform the data and generate insights.

## Data Transformation Process

1. **Staging Layer**:
   - Raw data is loaded from source files into staging tables.
   - Data cleaning, basic transformations, and schema adjustments are performed.

2. **Warehouse Layer**:
   - Data from the staging layer is further transformed into a structured warehouse layer.
   - Dimensional modeling techniques are applied to create fact and dimension tables.

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Advanced transformations and aggregations are applied to generate meaningful insights.
   - Views and materialized tables are created to facilitate analytics.

## Results and Insights

This project provides valuable insights into the Northwind Traders data, including (but not limited to):
- Top-selling products and categories.
- Customer purchasing behavior analysis.
- Revenue trends over time.
- ...and more.

Detailed query examples and visualization outputs can be found in the `sql` directory.
